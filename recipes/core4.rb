# we were setting 2.8.7 as the requested version, 3.x was being downloaded and installed and I
# Believe that is because of self-referencing attributes in the rabbitmq default attributes file. It appears
# that even though we are changing the value here in this recipe, that override happens after the URL
# was evaluatied, so reset the package URL location to ensure we get the version we want
# This is an exact lift from the attribute file...
