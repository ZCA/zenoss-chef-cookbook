## TBD
 - Default to installing 4.2.5
 - Updated to support new versions of yum cookbooks

## v2.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- The functionality of the `zenoss::client` has been moved out to
  a new dedicated [zenoss_client cookbook](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/zenoss_client)
  
- Default installation version has been increased to Core 4

- The hash value for `node['zenoss']['server']['installed_zenpacks']`
  has been cleared. The ZenPacks that were previously set here
  have equivalent ZenPacks now included by default. For those that need an easy
  reference the previous value was:

        "ZenPacks.zenoss.DeviceSearch" => "1.0.0",
        "ZenPacks.zenoss.LinuxMonitor"  => "1.1.5",
        "ZenPacks.community.MySQLSSH"  => "0.4",

- The inclusion of the SNMP cookbook is no longer included by this cookbook.
  While using Zenoss to poll SNMP is a **very** common setup, enforcing its 
  inclusion would alienate users who might to use direct SSH instead of SNMP.
  
### Enhancements

- Updates were made that should help reduce or eliminate the
  requirements on using search. Previous versions had a few
  hard coded requirements. Now the cookbook will attempt to 
  apply some sane actions when search is not available
  
- Managing Core 4 installations is now supported

## v1.0.0
